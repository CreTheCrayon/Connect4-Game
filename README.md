# Connect4-Game
A Connect-4 game I made as my final project in Python during my freshman year at WSUV. The UI is rather basic and so is the AI, but it was my first major project I undertook. The AI uses a "ply" system to determine how many moves ahead it can see. The higher the difficulty, the more ply it can use.
